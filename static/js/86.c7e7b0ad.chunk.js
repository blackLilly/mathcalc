He also believed that time was infinite and continuous, and that the universe always did, and always will exist. Interestingly, he was also one of, if not the first person to frame the idea that time existing of two different kinds of non-existence, makes time existing at all, questionable.

If the bucket's rotation is then stopped, the water remains concave during the period it continues to spin. Since this example showed that the concavity of the water was not based on an interaction between the bucket and the water, Newton claimed that the water was rotating in relation to a third entity, absolute space.

Einstein posited that the speed of light, c, in vacuum, is the same for all observers, independent of the motion of the light source, and relates distances measured in space with distances measured in time. Essentially, for observers within different inertial frames of reference (different relative velocities), both the shape of space as well as the measurement of time simultaneously change due to the invariance of the speed of light \u2013 a view vastly different from Newton's.

General relativity states: an object moving against a geodesic experiences a force, an object in free fall does not experience a force because it is following a geodesic, and an object on earth does experience a force because the surface of the planet applies a force against the geodesic to hold the object in place.

It is now used in a modified form for measuring time, as well as angles and geographic coordinates. Base 60 is used due to the number 60's status as a superior highly composite number having 12 factors. A superior highly composite number is a natural number, that relative to any other number scaled to some power of itself, has more divisors. The number 60, having as many factors as it does, simplifies many fractions involving sexagesimal numbers, and its mathematical advantage is one of the contributing factors to its continued use today.

Egyptian astronomers noticed patterns in a set of stars however, and used 12 of those stars to create 12 divisions of night. Having these two 12 part divisions of day and night is one theory behind where the concept of a 24-hour day originated. The divisions created by the Egyptians however, varied based on the time of the year, with summer hours being much longer than those of winter. It was not until later, around 147 to 127 BC that a Greek astronomer Hipparchus proposed dividing the day into 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness based on the days of the equinox.
